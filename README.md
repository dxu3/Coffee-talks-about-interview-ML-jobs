# Coffee-talks-about-interview-ML-jobs
As volunteers at Alberta AI association, me and Irene invited people for a coffee to talk about their experience in finding a job or how to work for an AI company. We hope it is helpful for new graduates in Alberta. You can always get in touch with us. My email is di@albertaai.org
